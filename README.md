Netflix-Movie-Recommendation
===========================


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Repository Overview:
--------------------



This project aims to build a model that Recommends Movies Netflix users based on User-User and Movie-Movie similarity.<br>
Netflix provided a lot of anonymous rating data, and a prediction accuracy bar that is 10% better than what Cinematch can do on<br>
the same training data set. (Accuracy is a measurement of how closely predicted ratings of movies match subsequent actual ratings.)
<br><br>
The repository has 1 ipython notebook.
<br>
1 [Netflix_Movie_2.ipynb](https://github.com/srvds/Netflix-Movie-Recommendation/blob/master/Netflix_Movie_2.ipynb)  
<br><br>
All the code is written in python 3 <br><br>

Introduction:
-------------

Netflix is all about connecting people to the movies they love. To help customers find those movies, they developed world-class movie recommendation system: CinematchSM. Its job is to predict whether someone will enjoy a movie based on how much they liked or disliked other movies. Netflix use those predictions to make personal movie recommendations based on each customerâ€™s unique tastes.

Netflix provided a lot of anonymous rating data, and a prediction accuracy bar that is 10% better than what Cinematch can do on the same training data set
<br>
For a given movie and user we need to predict the rating would be given by him/her to the movie. <br>
The given problem is a Recommendation problem <br>
It can also seen as a Regression problem <br>
<br>

This project tries many approaches and compares them

Dataset:
--------

The dataset can be downloaded from
https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data/data
<br><br>
<p> Data files : 
<ul> 
<li> combined_data_1.txt </li>
<li> combined_data_2.txt </li>
<li> combined_data_3.txt </li>
<li> combined_data_4.txt </li>
<li> movie_titles.csv </li>
</ul>
 
<br><br>
#### Understanding the dataset
The first line of each file [combined_data_1.txt, combined_data_2.txt, combined_data_3.txt, combined_data_4.txt] contains the movie id followed by a colon. Each subsequent line in the file corresponds to a rating from a customer and its date in the following format:

CustomerID,Rating,Date

MovieIDs range from 1 to 17770 sequentially.
CustomerIDs range from 1 to 2649429, with gaps. There are 480189 users.
Ratings are on a five star (integral) scale from 1 to 5.
Dates have the format YYYY-MM-DD.
#### Featurization
The four data files named combined_data_1.txt, combined_data_2.txt, combined_data_3.txt, combined_data_4.txt are Merged.
And whole data is formatted as: u_i:(user id i), m_j (movie id j), r_ij (rating of movie j by user i)

Many featurization and models are compared. The detailed documentation is in the Notebook.
